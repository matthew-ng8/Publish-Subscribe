# Publish-Subscribe

Can run sub_pub3.c to write to different terminals that are also running the same sub_pub3.c

pub_sub3.c can only run with up to 3 terminals. 1 of which are publishers and 2 are subscribers to the messages written in the publisher terminal

Publish.c and Subscribe.C work by sending messages through the kernel to each other through the pubsub.c
